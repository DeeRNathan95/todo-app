The differences between an attribute and property:

Attribute (HTML level):

“An attribute is a value defined in the HTML markup that sets the initial state of an element.”

Property (DOM/JS level):

“A property is a value stored in the DOM object in JavaScript, reflecting the current state of the element.”

Memory Trick

Think of it like this:

“Attributes are what’s written in the HTML; properties are what’s live in the page.”

Attributes = static, initial value in the markup.

Properties = dynamic, can change as the user interacts.
