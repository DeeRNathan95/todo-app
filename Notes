The differences between an attribute and property:

Attribute (HTML level):

“An attribute is a value defined in the HTML markup that sets the initial state of an element.”

Property (DOM/JS level):

“A property is a value stored in the DOM object in JavaScript, reflecting the current state of the element.”

Memory Trick

Think of it like this:

“Attributes are what’s written in the HTML; properties are what’s live in the page.”

Attributes = static, initial value in the markup.

Properties = dynamic, can change as the user interacts.

====================================================================
DOM Object Definition

A DOM (Document Object Model) object is the JavaScript representation of an HTML element in the browser. It allows you to access and manipulate elements dynamically using JS.

In simple terms:

The DOM is like a tree of objects created by the browser from your HTML.

Each HTML element becomes a DOM object with properties, methods, and events.

Example: HTML
<div id="myDiv">Hello World</div>

JS:
const div = document.getElementById('myDiv'); // div is a DOM object

console.log(div.innerHTML);  // "Hello World"  -> property
div.innerHTML = "Hi!";       // changes content on the page

<div> in HTML → DOM object in JS

innerHTML → property of that DOM object

addEventListener() → method of that DOM object

Memory Trick

HTML = blueprint; DOM object = live element in JS you can manipulate.

Think of it like: the HTML is the plan, the DOM is the actual “object” in memory you can touch, change, and interact with in your code.
