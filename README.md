## 📝 To-Do App — ReactJS Project

**Live Demo:** [https://todo-app.webstudiobydee.com](https://todo-app.webstudiobydee.com)

### 📌 Overview

This is a responsive and interactive **To-Do List application** built with **ReactJS**, designed to help users manage daily tasks with ease. It features task creation, completion toggling, and deletion — all wrapped in a clean, component-based architecture.

This project marks the beginning of my React journey, where I explored core concepts like state management, props, component composition, and dynamic rendering. It also served as my first deployment using Hostinger and subdomain structuring.

### 🌐 Deployment Notes

The app was deployed to a custom subdomain using Hostinger’s File Manager. The contents of the `dist` folder were uploaded to `/public_html/todo-app`, allowing the app to be accessed via:

> [https://todo-app.webstudiobydee.com](https://todo-app.webstudiobydee.com)

This structure supports future scalability, with each project hosted on its own subdomain.
